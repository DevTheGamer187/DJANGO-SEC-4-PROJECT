please download the every file and place it in the folder and activate the virtual environment 

there is a huge blunder of spelling mistake in my project coding that i named my project folder as **'receipe'** instead of recipe so, for getting into my project directory use cd **'receipebook'** instead of recipebook

also my app name is again **receipe** not recipe

py manage.py runserver will create a ip+port to access my project

THANK YOU !!!
